I am a bioinformatician by eduction. I develop systems biology models and machine learning algorithms to model and analyze gene regulation. Currently, I am developing models to enhance the functional interpretation of single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data by integrating genetics and single cell ATAC-seq (scATAC-seq) data in the context of different human brain disorders. 



## Short CV
I  received a master  in Bioinformatics from the [Max Planck Institute for Informatics](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/home/) and [Saarland University](https://zbi-www.bioinf.uni-sb.de/en) in Germany. I did my PhD. with the [International Max Planck Research School for Computer Science](https://www.imprs-cs.de/) at the Max Planck Institute for Informatics. While at Max Planck, I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Marcel Schulz](https://schulzlab.github.io/MS.html), also I was a visiting student at [Prof. Ernest Fraenkel's lab](http://fraenkel.mit.edu/).
 Since April 2019, I am a postdoctoral research associate under supervision of [Prof. Manolis Kellis](http://mit.edu/manoli/) with a joint appointment at [Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard](https://www.broadinstitute.org/), and [MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL)](https://www.csail.mit.edu/). In my spare time, I play soccer and go hiking. My favorite soccer player is Cristiano Ronaldo!
