My name is Azim, I'm a postdoc in [Professor Manolis Kellis's lab](http://compbio.mit.edu/compbio.html) in CSAIL, MIT. Perviously I was a PhD. student at Max Planck Institute for Informatics.

## Summary

The cell is a highly mysterious intelligent machine that fascinates my imagination and arouses my curiosity. My
research revolves around development and application of principled machine learning methods for interpreting
complex biological data sets. I love to design novel machine learning algorithms, especially when they allow the
analysis of data in ways that have not yet been possible. I am interested in working on fundamental biological
problems that would have an impact on our understanding of human cells and disease mechanisms. An ongoing theme in my research is the integration of multi-omics data sets to understand underlying biological processes that contribute to a specific phenotype.
