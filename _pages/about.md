I am an **AI scientist** specializing in Deep Learning and Bioinformatics. My work focuses on **LLMs** and **foundational models** to integrate multimodal data (omics, images, text, single-cell), unravel complex biological systems, and identify therapeutic targets. I also explore **generative biology** and perturbational modeling to design biological sequences and validate targets, and developing **agentic AI** systems to automate discovery, orchestrate complex analyses and experiment design

## Short Bio
I am currently a principal Artificial Intelligence scientist at [J&J](https://www.jnj.com/) working on AI/ML for multimodal data integration (omics, images, text, etc.), generative biology, and perturbational modeling. I received a master's in Bioinformatics from the [Max Planck Institute for Informatics](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/home/) and [Saarland University](https://zbi-www.bioinf.uni-sb.de/en) in Germany. I did my PhD with the [International Max Planck Research School for Computer Science](https://www.imprs-cs.de/) at the Max Planck Institute for Informatics. While at Max Planck, I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Marcel Schulz](https://schulzlab.github.io/MS.html). I was also a visiting student at [Prof. Ernest Fraenkel's lab](http://fraenkel.mit.edu/).
 From April 2019 - February 2021, I was a postdoctoral research associate at [Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard](https://www.broadinstitute.org/), and [MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL)](https://www.csail.mit.edu/) under the supervision  of [Prof. Manolis Kellis](http://compbio.mit.edu/compbio.html). In my spare time, I play soccer and go hiking. My favorite soccer player is [Cristiano Ronaldo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUKGsb8CpF8&t=412s).
