I am a *data scientist* (Machine Learning & Bioinformatics) by eduction. My main focus is on the problems at the interface of Artificial Intelligence and Bioinformatics. I develop and use state of art deep learning and machine learning algorithms to learn, infer and predict the regulatory circuitry in biological systems.
Perviously, I've developed systems biology models and machine learning algorithms to model and analyze gene regulation.

## Short Bio
I  received a master  in Bioinformatics from the [Max Planck Institute for Informatics](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/home/) and [Saarland University](https://zbi-www.bioinf.uni-sb.de/en) in Germany. I did my PhD. with the [International Max Planck Research School for Computer Science](https://www.imprs-cs.de/) at the Max Planck Institute for Informatics. While at Max Planck, I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Marcel Schulz](https://schulzlab.github.io/MS.html), also I was a visiting student at [Prof. Ernest Fraenkel's lab](http://fraenkel.mit.edu/).
 Since April 2019, I am a postdoctoral research associate at [Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard](https://www.broadinstitute.org/), and [MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL)](https://www.csail.mit.edu/). In my spare time, I play soccer and go hiking. My favorite soccer player is [Cristiano Ronaldo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUyXa1SOeXQ).
